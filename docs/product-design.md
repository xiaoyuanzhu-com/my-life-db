MyLifeDB v1.2 — Product Requirements Document

1. Vision & Philosophy

MyLifeDB is a personal knowledge companion that helps people record, reflect, and evolve their thinking — while keeping full ownership of their data.

Principles
	1.	Frictionless capture: users never think “where should this go?”
	2.	AI-assisted structure: the system surfaces relationships; the user confirms meaning.
	3.	Human-centered design: interface feels analog, calm, and trustworthy.
	4.	Open formats (future phase): all data remains readable, exportable, and independent.
	5.	Long-term continuity: the system matures with the user’s thinking.

2. Core Model

Concept	Description	User Perception
Inbox	Stream of everything you capture — text, media, voice, ideas, integrations.	“My daily flow.”
Library	Organized and meaningful knowledge, built gradually from the Inbox.	“Where things I care about live.”

Hidden conceptual lifecycle:
Stream → Reflection → Pattern → Principle

3. User Journey Overview

Stage	Goal	System Role
Capture	Quickly record ideas, notes, or data	Minimal UI, automatic enrichment
Reflect	Notice connections or repetitions	AI clustering & suggestion digest
Structure	Approve groupings → create Spaces	One-click confirmation
Revisit	Browse or search by theme or time	Context-rich navigation
Evolve	Observe emerging principles	Summaries, trends, insights


⸻

4. Primary UI Pages

4.1 Home / Inbox (Default Landing)

Purpose: frictionless capture and review.

Main elements
	•	Quick-add bar (always visible):
	•	text input, image/file upload, voice capture
	•	keyboard shortcuts (⌘N, Ctrl+Enter)
	•	Stream view: vertical chronological feed
	•	card for each entry (title, snippet, date, source icon)
	•	subtle tag chips auto-added by AI
	•	Filter bar: All · Notes · Media · Links · Voice · AI Clusters
	•	AI summary panel (right side / slide-up):
	•	“You created 27 entries this week”
	•	“3 possible clusters detected: Sleep, Focus, Journaling”

Actions
	•	Edit / pin / delete / merge
	•	“Add to Space” → choose existing Library space or create new
	•	“Reflect” → opens side panel with AI insights on that item’s context

⸻

4.2 Reflection View

Triggered by: weekly notification or user clicking “Reflect Now.”

Purpose: present AI-found patterns and ask for confirmation.

Layout
	•	Left column: Suggested Clusters
	•	Example: Focus & Energy (5 items, 82% confidence)
	•	Center: Item list preview with snippets and sources
	•	Right panel: Quick actions
	•	✅ Confirm (creates/updates Library Space)
	•	✏️ Rename cluster
	•	🔗 Merge with existing Space
	•	🕓 Remind me later (snooze)

Additional section: “Emerging Topics”
Shows low-confidence groups (<60%) for user review.

⸻

4.3 Library (Structured Knowledge)

Purpose: organized, enduring spaces created from Inbox material.

Main components
	•	Sidebar: list of Spaces (e.g., Health, Projects, Books, People)
	•	Main view: open selected Space
	•	Header: title, description, cover image
	•	Tabs:
	•	Notes (linked items)
	•	Insights (AI-generated summaries, stats)
	•	Principles (user-confirmed reflections)
	•	Right panel: cross-links to related Spaces (“Sleep ↔ Focus”)

User actions
	•	Edit description, merge Spaces, tag manually
	•	Mark insights as “Principles” (persistent truths)
	•	Export Space as markdown folder

⸻

4.4 Search & Navigation

Unified Search Bar
	•	Typing shows hybrid results:
	•	Inbox items (by time or content)
	•	Library Spaces
	•	AI-derived principles
	•	Natural-language support:
“show everything about focus last month”
“find notes that led to the ‘Energy’ space”

Filters
	•	Time (calendar picker)
	•	Source type (manual, integration)
	•	Confidence (AI grouping strength)

⸻

4.5 Insights / Journal Summary (Optional v1+)

Purpose: help users reflect on trends over time.
Content:
	•	Weekly summary: new clusters, updated Spaces
	•	Word cloud or topic heatmap
	•	Highlighted principles promoted this month
	•	Links to Library updates

⸻

5. Detailed User Flows

Flow 1 — Capturing an Entry

  U->>App: Type note or drop file
  App->>AI: Send for lightweight processing
  AI-->>App: Return tags & possible related topics
  App-->>U: Show confirmation chip ("Linked to Sleep?")
  U->>App: Ignore or accept suggestion
  App->>Store: Save to Inbox feed


⸻

Flow 2 — Creating Structure

  AI->>U: Weekly digest: "7 items relate to Focus"
  U->>AI: Accept suggestion
  AI->>L: Create Space "Focus"
  L->>U: Display new Space with linked items
  U->>L: Add title and short note


⸻

Flow 3 — Surfacing Insights

sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant L as Library
  participant AI as Insight Engine

  U->>L: Open Space "Sleep"
  L->>AI: Request summary
  AI-->>L: "Average capture frequency: 3/wk; common themes: stress, recovery"
  L-->>U: Display insight panel + "Add to Principle"
  U->>L: Promote to principle

6. Inbox → Library Transformation Logic (Behavioral Rules)

Trigger	Condition	Result
AI detects ≥3 similar items	within 2 weeks, ≥70% similarity	Propose new Space
User confirms suggestion	explicit accept	Create new Library Space
User edits title	renames Space	Update cluster label
User ignores suggestion	no action	remains in Inbox
User deletes Space	remove structure, items revert to Inbox	
Library Space unused for 90 days	passive state	prompt to archive


⸻

7. Key Features Summary

Area	Feature	Purpose
Capture	Single unified input	Always-available quick capture
	Multi-modal inputs	text, file, voice, integration feed
Organization	AI-based clustering	Automatically identify topics

8. Interface Design Overview

Page	Key Elements	Primary Actions	Emotional Goal
Inbox	input bar, stream feed, AI side panel	capture, tag, reflect	speed, freedom

Summary (optional)	trend charts, highlights	read, reflect	satisfaction, growth


⸻

9. Design Tone & Visual Cues
	•	Aesthetic: white background, soft gradients, minimal icons.
	•	Typography: clean sans-serif (SF Pro / Inter), generous spacing.
	•	Colors:
	•	Inbox: light blue / gray — motion, openness.
	•	Library: warm beige / off-white — stability, reflection.
	•	Motion: items “settle” from stream to shelf; micro-animation when clustering completes.
	•	Voice: polite, conversational — “Looks like you’ve been exploring sleep patterns.”

⸻

10. Open Format (to be defined in tech spec)
	•	Plain-text files for notes and Spaces.
	•	Metadata will remain minimal, human-readable.
	•	No proprietary database; portable structure indexes.
	•	All AI decisions logged for transparency and reproducibility.

(Detailed data schema deferred to Technical Design Doc.)

⸻

11. Non-Goals (v1)
	•	No team collaboration (individual use only).
	•	No complex API integrations beyond capture collectors.
	•	No gamification or scoring.
	•	No lock-in dependencies (must work offline by design).

13. Summary

MyLifeDB is a two-zone knowledge companion —
Inbox for free capture, Library for meaningful structure.

AI quietly helps users transform their daily stream into a lifelong library of principles and reflections.
The design is simple enough for a daily habit, powerful enough to grow with a lifetime of data, and open enough to never hold knowledge hostage.
